% Program by Krish Mangal, R Harsha Vardhan and R Umesh Reddy, this program
% will be available for download in MATLAB central forever, on the Harsha's
% Account( http://goo.gl/cd7c ) along with other interesting programs we have 
% developed or will develop in future.
% 
% This program identifies all of the moving objects in a recorded video and
% shows those objects in color while displaying the other stationary
% objects in grayscale. This is a basic program which may be used with
% other programs which use applications of Motion Detection. Details of
% this technique are expained in the project report which comes along with
% this Program. We have used the function mmread also available on matlab
% central in our program, you must download this program also and add its
% location to MATLAB's path.
